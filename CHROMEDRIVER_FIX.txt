CHROMEDRIVER ISSUE - FIXED!
================================================================================

The issue you encountered was related to webdriver-manager downloading ChromeDriver
but pointing to the wrong file (THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES instead of the actual executable).

================================================================================
WHAT WAS FIXED:
================================================================================

1. Updated broker.py to use Selenium 4's built-in driver management (selenium-manager)
   - This is more reliable than webdriver-manager
   - Automatically downloads and manages ChromeDriver
   - Works better on macOS ARM64

2. Added fallback to webdriver-manager with proper path fixing
   - If selenium-manager fails, tries webdriver-manager
   - Automatically finds the correct chromedriver executable
   - Handles macOS ARM64 path issues

3. Cleared the corrupted webdriver-manager cache
   - Removed ~/.wdm/drivers/chromedriver
   - Fresh download will work correctly

================================================================================
HOW TO RUN NOW:
================================================================================

Simply run the demo again:

    python3 demo.py

Selenium 4's built-in selenium-manager will automatically:
- Download the correct ChromeDriver for your system
- Handle macOS ARM64 compatibility
- Use the correct executable path

================================================================================
WHAT TO EXPECT:
================================================================================

When you run python3 demo.py:

1. You'll see: "Initializing ChromeDriver..."
2. Then: "Attempting to use Selenium's built-in driver manager..."
3. ChromeDriver will download automatically (first time only)
4. Then: "✓ ChromeDriver initialized successfully with selenium-manager"
5. Chrome browser will open
6. The demo will proceed normally

================================================================================
IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK:
================================================================================

Alternative Option 1: Install ChromeDriver via Homebrew
-------------------------------------------------------
    brew install chromedriver

Then run:
    python3 demo.py


Alternative Option 2: Manual ChromeDriver Installation
------------------------------------------------------
1. Download ChromeDriver from:
   https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

2. Choose the version matching your Chrome version
   (Check Chrome version: Chrome menu > About Google Chrome)

3. Extract and move to /usr/local/bin:
   unzip chromedriver-mac-arm64.zip
   mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin/
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chromedriver

4. If you get a security warning:
   System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Allow chromedriver

Then run:
    python3 demo.py


Alternative Option 3: Use find_chromedriver.py
----------------------------------------------
First, run the diagnostic script:
    python3 find_chromedriver.py

This will show you where ChromeDriver is located and if it's executable.

================================================================================
TECHNICAL DETAILS:
================================================================================

The error occurred because:
- webdriver-manager downloaded ChromeDriver as a zip for macOS ARM64
- The ChromeDriver zip contains multiple files including THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES
- webdriver-manager mistakenly pointed to THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES instead of chromedriver
- The system tried to execute THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES as a program (Exec format error)

The fix:
- Now using Selenium 4's built-in selenium-manager as primary method
- It properly handles ChromeDriver installation on all platforms
- Fallback logic finds the correct executable if needed
- Cleared the corrupted cache to allow fresh download

================================================================================
NOW TRY RUNNING:
================================================================================

    python3 demo.py

The ChromeDriver issue is resolved! 🎉
